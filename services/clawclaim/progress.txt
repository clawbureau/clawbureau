## Codebase Patterns
- Cloudflare Worker service under `services/clawclaim/`.
- Prefer KV for short-lived challenge storage (10-minute TTL).
- Keep responses JSON and fail closed when required bindings are missing.

## 2026-02-02 - CCL-US-001
- Scaffolded `services/clawclaim` Worker.
- Implemented `POST /v1/challenges`:
  - Issues short-lived nonce + deterministic signing message.
  - Stores challenge record in KV with TTL (default 600s).
- Added `GET /health` + `GET /skill.md`.
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`.
