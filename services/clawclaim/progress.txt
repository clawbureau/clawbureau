## Codebase Patterns
- Cloudflare Worker service under `services/clawclaim/`.
- Prefer KV for short-lived challenge storage (10-minute TTL).
- Keep responses JSON and fail closed when required bindings are missing.

## 2026-02-02 - CCL-US-002
- Added `POST /v1/bind`:
  - Loads stored challenge from KV, validates expiry + DID match.
  - Verifies Ed25519 signature for `did:key` DIDs.
  - Stores a binding record in KV and marks it `active: true`.
  - Deletes challenge on success to prevent replay.
- Added crypto helpers for did:key Ed25519 verification.
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`.
