## Codebase Patterns
- Cloudflare Worker service under `services/clawclaim/`.
- Prefer KV for short-lived challenge storage (10-minute TTL).
- Keep responses JSON and fail closed when required bindings are missing.

## 2026-02-02 - CCL-US-001
- Scaffolded `services/clawclaim` Worker.
- Implemented `POST /v1/challenges`:
  - Issues short-lived nonce + deterministic signing message.
  - Stores challenge record in KV with TTL (default 600s).
- Added `GET /health` + `GET /skill.md`.
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`.

## 2026-02-02 - CCL-US-002
- Added `POST /v1/bind`:
  - Loads stored challenge from KV, validates expiry + DID match.
  - Verifies Ed25519 signature for `did:key` DIDs.
  - Stores a binding record in KV and marks it `active: true`.
  - Deletes challenge on success to prevent replay.
- Added crypto helpers for did:key Ed25519 verification.
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`.

## 2026-02-02 - CCL-US-003
- Added revoke-capable challenges via `POST /v1/challenges` with optional `purpose` (default: `bind`).
- Implemented `POST /v1/bindings/revoke`:
  - Loads stored challenge from KV, validates expiry + DID match + purpose.
  - Verifies did:key (Ed25519) signature over the challenge message.
  - Marks binding revoked (`active: false`) with `revoked_at` metadata.
  - Logs KV audit event (`events:bindings:*`).
  - Deletes challenge on success to prevent replay.
- Prevent new sessions:
  - Blocks new bind challenges when a binding is revoked.
  - Rejects bind attempts if binding is revoked.
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`.
