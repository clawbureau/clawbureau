## Codebase Patterns
- Services live in `services/<service-name>/` and are typically Cloudflare Workers.
- Keep secrets in wrangler secrets; fail closed when required keys are missing.
- CST format: JWT (JWS compact) signed with Ed25519 (alg=EdDSA).

## 2026-02-02 - CSC-US-001
- Scaffolded clawscope Worker at `services/clawscope/`.
- Implemented admin-gated token issuance: `POST /v1/tokens/issue`.
  - Issues Ed25519-signed JWT (JWS compact, `alg=EdDSA`).
  - Claims align with `packages/schema/auth/scoped_token_claims.v1.json`.
  - Enforces TTL + scope size/length limits.
  - Returns `token_hash` (SHA-256 hex) + `policy_version`.
- Added key discovery:
  - `GET /v1/jwks` (OKP Ed25519)
  - `GET /v1/did`
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Other services (e.g. clawproxy) validate CSTs as EdDSA JWT and require a configured issuer public key.
  - Keeping the issuer key discoverable via JWKS allows offline verification.
