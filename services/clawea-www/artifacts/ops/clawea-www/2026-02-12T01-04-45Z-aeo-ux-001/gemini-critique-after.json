      "exact_fix_recommendation": "Add a pill-shaped badge labeled 'Most Popular' or 'Recommended' to the top border of the Business card to explicitly signal social proof and guide selection.",
      "accessibility_impact": "Relying solely on border color to indicate the preferred plan fails for color-blind users; a text label ensures the recommendation is accessible to all.",
