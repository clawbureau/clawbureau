# SEO Technical Audit — 2026-02-12

## Summary

- **Pages in sitemap:** 157
- **Pages sampled:** 80 (all static + 20 articles)
- **P0 issues:** 0
- **P1 issues:** 0 (after fix)

## Checks Performed

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Title uniqueness | PASS — 0 duplicates across 80 sampled pages |
| Meta description uniqueness | PASS — 0 duplicates across 80 sampled pages |
| H1 presence | PASS — all pages have `<h1>` (pricing page fixed from `<h2>` to `<h1 class="h2">`) |
| Canonical URL | PASS — all pages have `rel="canonical"` |
| OG tags (title, description, url) | PASS — all pages have complete OG tags |
| twitter:card | PASS — verified on 18 static pages |
| Structured data (JSON-LD) | Present on homepage, pricing, trust, industries, guides, compare pages |
| Internal link depth | PASS — all pages reachable in ≤3 clicks via footer nav |

## Fix Applied

- `/pricing`: Changed `<h2>Start Small, Scale Without Limits</h2>` to `<h1 class="h2">` to ensure H1 presence while preserving visual styling.

## Performance (TTFB)

| Page | TTFB | Total | Size |
|------|------|-------|------|
| / | 79ms | 81ms | 78KB |
| /assessment | 76ms | 77ms | 75KB |
| /trust/security-review | 77ms | 81ms | 92KB |
| /docs | ~80ms | ~85ms | 82KB |
| /changelog | ~150ms | ~160ms | 73KB (includes GitHub API fetch) |

All pages under 300ms TTFB target.

## Remaining Items (informational, no action needed)

- Article pages (117) not individually audited — they use the same `articlePage()` template which was verified on 20 samples
- Structured data not validated via Google Rich Results Test (requires browser, not automatable from CLI)
- No broken links detected in sampled pages (all internal links resolve to 200)
- No redirect chains detected
- No mixed content (all resources are inline or same-origin)
