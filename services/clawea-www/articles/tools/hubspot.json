  "html": "<p>If you want enterprise agents to operate in HubSpot without turning your CRM into an unbounded action surface, you need permissioned execution. Claw EA runs agents on the OpenClaw baseline runtime and adds policy-as-code gates using WPC plus token scoping using CST, so HubSpot reads and writes happen only under explicit, reviewable constraints.</p>\n<p>HubSpot can be connected via official API with enterprise buildout controls, not as a native connector on day one. The key is to make every HubSpot capability a named tool with an allowlist, scope limits, and an approval boundary for write and admin actions.</p>\n\n<h2>Step-by-step runbook</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Inventory the HubSpot actions you actually need: read objects (contacts, companies, deals), create or update records, enroll workflows, manage properties, or access Sensitive Data. Write down which teams own each action and what “bad” looks like (wrong email, wrong lifecycle stage, leaking sensitive fields).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Define a WPC = Work Policy Contract for HubSpot operations. Keep it concrete: which object types are allowed, which properties may be touched, which pipelines are in scope, and what requires human approval.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Issue a CST = scoped token (issued by clawscope) for each job or session. Pin the CST scope hash to the WPC hash where you need strong coupling, so the runtime cannot silently swap policy mid-run.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Implement the HubSpot connection via official API with an enterprise buildout. Map HubSpot OAuth scopes (or an equivalent least-privilege authentication design) to the WPC, and fail closed when the requested action is outside policy.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Route model calls through clawproxy so you get gateway receipts for model calls. Store the resulting proof bundle alongside the job output so audit can answer “what did the model see and what did it decide” for each HubSpot change request.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Start with read-only in production and run write paths in a controlled pilot. For any write path, require a WPC approval gate for actions like bulk updates, lifecycle stage changes, pipeline moves, Sensitive Data access, or anything that triggers customer messaging.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Threat model</h2>\n<p>HubSpot is high impact because small changes can trigger downstream automations, sales motions, and customer communications. A prompt-only agent can be coerced into doing the wrong thing even if its intent was correct, especially when it is exposed to untrusted text like inbound emails, meeting notes, or chat transcripts.</p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Threat</th>\n      <th>What happens</th>\n      <th>Control</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Prompt injection causes unauthorized write</td>\n      <td>The agent edits contact properties, changes lifecycle stage, or creates tasks based on hostile instructions embedded in text.</td>\n      <td>WPC allowlists for tool verbs and objects; write actions require WPC approval gates; CST scope limits enforce least privilege even if the prompt is compromised.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Over-broad OAuth scopes or shared credentials</td>\n      <td>A single agent session can access unrelated pipelines, teams, or Sensitive Data beyond the intended job.</td>\n      <td>CST per job with narrow scope; optional policy hash pinning; separate credentials per environment and per agent role in the enterprise buildout.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Bulk update or search misuse</td>\n      <td>The agent runs a wide CRM search and then updates many records due to a bad filter or misread instruction.</td>\n      <td>WPC caps on max objects per run; require explicit query constraints; approval gates for bulk actions; produce proof bundles for later verification.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Sensitive fields exfiltration</td>\n      <td>The agent reads Sensitive Data properties and echoes them into model context or logs, creating compliance exposure.</td>\n      <td>WPC denies Sensitive Data scopes by default; only allow for a named workflow with approval; redact outputs at the agent boundary; keep model calls behind clawproxy receipts to support investigations.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Misconfigured tool surface in the runtime</td>\n      <td>A plugin exposes more tool methods than intended, or runs with elevated local execution and can pivot.</td>\n      <td>Use OpenClaw tool policy and sandboxing to limit local blast radius; rely on WPC for remote tool authorization and CST for session scoping.</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Policy-as-code example</h2>\n<p>This is a JSON-like sketch of a WPC that permits a narrow HubSpot workflow: read contacts and deals, create a note, and update a small set of fields. Anything bulk, admin, or Sensitive Data is denied unless explicitly approved.</p>\n<pre>\n{\n  \"wpc_version\": \"v1\",\n  \"policy_name\": \"hubspot-sales-assistant-prod\",\n  \"tool\": \"hubspot_via_official_api\",\n  \"environment\": \"prod\",\n  \"allow\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"crm.contacts.read\",\n      \"constraints\": { \"fields_allowlist\": [\"firstname\", \"lastname\", \"email\", \"company\", \"lifecyclestage\"] }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"crm.deals.read\",\n      \"constraints\": { \"pipelines_allowlist\": [\"sales_pipeline_us\"], \"max_results\": 50 }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"crm.notes.create\",\n      \"constraints\": { \"max_body_chars\": 1200, \"must_link_to\": [\"contact\", \"deal\"] }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"crm.contacts.update\",\n      \"constraints\": { \"fields_allowlist\": [\"lifecyclestage\", \"lead_status\"], \"max_objects\": 5 }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"deny\": [\n    { \"action\": \"crm.*.delete\" },\n    { \"action\": \"crm.bulk.*\" },\n    { \"action\": \"sensitive_data.*\" },\n    { \"action\": \"settings.*\" }\n  ],\n  \"approvals_required\": [\n    { \"action\": \"crm.contacts.update\", \"when\": { \"fields_any\": [\"lifecyclestage\"] } }\n  ],\n  \"audit\": {\n    \"require_gateway_receipts\": true,\n    \"require_proof_bundle\": true\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Prompt text alone cannot guarantee these boundaries, because prompts are not an execution control. A WPC is a signed, hash-addressed policy artifact that can be fetched and verified, and the runtime can fail closed when a tool call does not match the contract.</p>\n\n<h2>What proof do you get?</h2>\n<p>For each run, Claw EA can produce gateway receipts for model calls emitted by clawproxy. Those receipts let you verify which model was called, when, and under which job context, without trusting an application log that could be edited after the fact.</p>\n<p>Claw EA also produces a proof bundle that packages the gateway receipts and related metadata needed for audit and verification. If you publish or retain the result for review, you can store it as a Trust Pulse artifact for later viewing and replay checks, including marketplace anti-replay binding using job-scoped CST binding.</p>\n<p>For HubSpot actions performed via official API in an enterprise buildout, you should also keep the request intent and the resolved policy decision (allowed or denied) alongside the proof bundle. This makes it practical to answer: which WPC governed the write, which CST was used, and what the agent believed it was doing at the time.</p>\n\n<h2>Rollback posture</h2>\n<p>Rollback for CRM changes needs to be planned because “undo” is not always a single operation. Treat rollback as a first-class run outcome: capture before-values for any write you allow, and store them with the job’s proof bundle so an operator can reconstruct prior state.</p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Action</th>\n      <th>Safe rollback</th>\n      <th>Evidence</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Update a small set of contact properties</td>\n      <td>Write previous values back for the specific fields changed; restrict to the same object ids.</td>\n      <td>Proof bundle referencing the WPC hash, CST scope hash, and the tool decision record for each field change.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Create a note or task</td>\n      <td>Mark as erroneous via a follow-up note or delete only if policy allows delete; prefer append-only rollback where possible.</td>\n      <td>Job output plus proof bundle; retain object ids created so you can locate artifacts quickly.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Deal stage or lifecycle changes</td>\n      <td>Require human confirmation before rollback; apply only after validating downstream automation impact.</td>\n      <td>WPC approval record (outside prompt), plus gateway receipts for the model call that recommended the change.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Bulk updates</td>\n      <td>Do not allow by default; if implemented, require staged rollout and a rollback plan that replays a stored snapshot.</td>\n      <td>Explicit WPC exception, plus a proof bundle for each batch and a stored snapshot reference.</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If you need stronger guarantees, you can implement additional controls in the enterprise buildout, like an external change journal and precondition checks. Keep the default posture conservative until you have operational muscle for CRM incident response.</p>\n\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n<h3>Is this a native HubSpot connector in Claw EA today?</h3>\n<p>No. HubSpot can be connected via official API with enterprise buildout controls, and the integration should be treated as an implementation project with explicit auth scope design and tool boundaries.</p>\n\n<h3>Why is prompt-only control not enough for HubSpot actions?</h3>\n<p>Prompts are advisory and can be overridden by injected text, ambiguous instructions, or model error. Policy-as-code (WPC) is enforceable at execution time, and CST scoping prevents the agent from acquiring permissions that were never granted.</p>\n\n<h3>What HubSpot actions should require approvals?</h3>\n<p>Start by requiring WPC approval gates for anything that changes lifecycle stage, moves deals across pipelines, triggers customer messaging, or touches Sensitive Data. Also gate bulk operations and any admin or settings changes.</p>\n\n<h3>What do gateway receipts and proof bundles buy me in practice?</h3>\n<p>They let you verify model-call history for a run and tie it to a job-scoped authorization context. When a CRM incident happens, you can audit what the model was asked, what it returned, and which policy allowed the resulting tool call.</p>\n\n<h3>How does this relate to OpenClaw sandboxing and tool policy?</h3>\n<p>OpenClaw controls local execution boundaries, such as which tools exist and whether tool execution runs in a sandboxed environment. Claw EA adds a permissioned execution layer for remote actions like HubSpot API calls, using WPC, CST, gateway receipts, and proof bundles to make those actions auditable and fail-closed.</p>\n\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/5d4f42016f3afdbd5218843648d3ea594541dedc/docs/gateway/security/index.md\">OpenClaw Gateway Security (audit + footguns)</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/5d4f42016f3afdbd5218843648d3ea594541dedc/docs/gateway/sandbox-vs-tool-policy-vs-elevated.md\">OpenClaw: Sandbox vs Tool Policy vs Elevated</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/apps/developer-platform/add-features/agent-tools/overview\">Agents and tools overview (BETA) - HubSpot docs</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api-reference/crm-sensitive-data/guide\">Access and manage Sensitive Data - HubSpot docs</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/user-management/hubspot-user-permissions-guide?hubs_content=knowledge.hubspot.com%2Fko%2Fai-tools%2Fuse-copilot&hubs_content-cta=%EC%8A%88%ED%8D%BC-%EA%B4%80%EB%A6%AC%EC%9E%90%EB%8A%94\">HubSpot user permissions guide</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"cta-banner\" data-cta=\"bofu-endcap\">\n  <h2>Ready to put this workflow into production?</h2>\n  <p>Get a scoped deployment plan with Work Policy Contracts, approval gates, and cryptographic proof bundles for your team.</p>\n  <a href=\"/contact\" class=\"cta-btn cta-btn-lg\" data-cta=\"bofu-talk-to-sales\">Talk to Sales</a>\n  <a href=\"/trust\" class=\"cta-btn cta-btn-outline cta-btn-lg\" style=\"margin-left:.75rem\" data-cta=\"bofu-trust-layer\">Review Trust Layer</a>\n</div>\n",
