## Codebase Patterns
- clawcontrols is a Cloudflare Worker that hosts governance/policy contracts.
- Work Policy Contracts (WPC) are addressed by a content hash: policy_hash_b64u = sha256(JCS(payload)).
- Registry responses return signed envelopes (Ed25519) so clients can verify integrity.
- Storage is Durable Objects (single registry DO) for simple key→value lookup.

## 2026-02-10T00:38:35Z - CCO-US-021
- What was implemented
  - New service: `services/clawcontrols/`.
  - Signed Work Policy Contract (WPC) registry API:
    - `POST /v1/wpc` (admin-gated) creates/returns a signed envelope.
    - `GET /v1/wpc/:policy_hash_b64u` fetches by hash.
  - Canonical hashing: `policy_hash_b64u = sha256(JCS(wpc_payload))` (base64url).
- Files changed
  - services/clawcontrols/*
- Quality checks
  - cd services/clawcontrols && npm run typecheck && npm test

## 2026-02-11 - POHVN-US-005 (WPC hooks: model identity tier + audit packs)
- What was implemented
  - Extended the strict WPC v1 shape to include:
    - `minimum_model_identity_tier`
    - `required_audit_packs[]` (audit_pack_hash_b64u)
  - Validation remains fail-closed on unknown keys.
- Tests
  - Updated DO tests to ensure idempotent hashing still holds with new fields.
- Quality checks
  - cd services/clawcontrols && npm run typecheck && npm test
