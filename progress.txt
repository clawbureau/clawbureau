## Codebase Patterns
- Services live in `services/<service-name>/` with Cloudflare Worker structure
- Use wrangler.toml for Worker config, tsconfig.json with strict mode
- Package naming: @clawbureau/<service-name>
- Receipt hashes use SHA-256 hex encoding
- Types exported from `src/types.ts`, providers from `src/providers.ts`
- Security events use structured logging via `src/logging.ts` with [SECURITY] prefix
- Rate limiting uses Cloudflare Workers Rate Limiting binding (PROXY_RATE_LIMITER)
- Rate limit key preference: X-Client-DID header > CF-Connecting-IP (IP address)
- CST auth: when X-Client-DID is set, require X-CST (or X-Scoped-Token) and validate as EdDSA JWT (aud/exp/scope) before processing
- Receipt binding via X-Run-Id, X-Event-Hash, X-Idempotency-Key headers (idempotency.ts)
- WPC enforcement via X-Confidential-Mode and X-Policy-Hash headers (policy.ts)
- Policy violations return 403 with POLICY_* error codes
- Receipt privacy via X-Receipt-Privacy-Mode header (hash_only default, encrypted optional)
- AES-256-GCM encryption uses Web Crypto with 12-byte IV and 128-bit tag
- Encrypted mode blocked in confidential mode to protect prompts

## 2026-02-02 - CPX-US-001
- Implemented clawproxy Cloudflare Worker foundation
- Created POST /v1/proxy/:provider endpoint routing to Anthropic/OpenAI
- Added receipt generation with SHA-256 hashes of request/response bodies
- Files created:
  - services/clawproxy/package.json
  - services/clawproxy/wrangler.toml
  - services/clawproxy/tsconfig.json
  - services/clawproxy/src/index.ts (main entry)
  - services/clawproxy/src/types.ts (Receipt, Provider types)
  - services/clawproxy/src/providers.ts (Anthropic/OpenAI routing)
  - services/clawproxy/src/receipt.ts (receipt generation)

---

## 2026-02-02 - CPX-US-002
- Implemented Ed25519 receipt signing for cryptographically verifiable receipts
- Added GET /v1/did endpoint to expose proxy DID + public key for verification
- All proxy requests now fail closed (503) if PROXY_SIGNING_KEY is not configured
- Files modified:
  - services/clawproxy/src/types.ts (added DidResponse interface)
  - services/clawproxy/src/crypto.ts (added Ed25519 import/sign/verify functions, computeKeyId)
  - services/clawproxy/src/receipt.ts (added SigningContext, signing support in generateReceipt)
  - services/clawproxy/src/index.ts (added /v1/did endpoint, fail-closed logic, signing integration)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Ed25519 keys stored as base64url-encoded raw 32-byte seed in PROXY_SIGNING_KEY secret
  - PKCS8 wrapping is required for Web Crypto API Ed25519 import (16-byte header prepended to seed)
  - DID format: did:web:clawproxy.com with kid as truncated SHA-256 hash of public key
  - Receipt signature covers JSON-serialized payload excluding signature field
  - Signing context is cached at module level after first request
  - Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600 set on /v1/did responses
---

## 2026-02-02 - CPX-US-003
- Implemented structured security logging for blocked provider attempts
- Added logging.ts with SecurityEvent types and logBlockedProvider function
- Provider validation now logs BLOCKED_UNKNOWN_PROVIDER events with client IP, user agent, and attempted provider
- Added getSupportedProviders() helper for dynamic error messages
- Files created:
  - services/clawproxy/src/logging.ts (security event logging)
- Files modified:
  - services/clawproxy/src/index.ts (integrated logging, improved error messages)
  - services/clawproxy/src/providers.ts (added getSupportedProviders helper)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Security events use console.warn with [SECURITY] prefix for Cloudflare Workers observability
  - Client IP available via CF-Connecting-IP header in Cloudflare Workers
  - Structured JSON logging enables filtering/querying in observability tools
  - Keep security logging functions separate in logging.ts for reuse
---

## 2026-02-02 - CPX-US-004
- Added Google Gemini provider support to clawproxy
- Implemented dynamic URL building for Gemini's model-in-path requirement
- Added model validation for Google provider (required for URL construction)

  - services/clawproxy/src/types.ts (added 'google' to Provider union type)
  - services/clawproxy/src/providers.ts (added Google config, buildProviderUrl function)
  - services/clawproxy/src/index.ts (integrated buildProviderUrl, added Google model validation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Gemini API uses `x-goog-api-key` header for authentication (not Bearer token)
  - Gemini URL format: `models/{model}:generateContent` - model is path param, not body-only
  - Use buildProviderUrl() for all providers; returns static URL for most, dynamic for Google
  - Gemini responses include `usageMetadata` field automatically passed through
---

## 2026-02-02 - CPX-US-005
- Implemented POST /v1/verify-receipt endpoint for validating receipt signatures
- Added VerifyReceiptRequest and VerifyReceiptResponse types
- Validates receipt structure, proxyDid match, kid match, and Ed25519 signature
- Returns provider/model claims on successful verification
- Files modified:
  - services/clawproxy/src/types.ts (added VerifyReceiptRequest, VerifyReceiptResponse interfaces)
  - services/clawproxy/src/crypto.ts (added importEd25519PublicKey for SPKI format import)
  - services/clawproxy/src/index.ts (added /v1/verify-receipt route, handleVerifyReceipt handler, validateReceiptStructure helper)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Receipt verification uses the cached signing context's public key (same key used for signing)
  - createSigningPayload() from receipt.ts produces deterministic JSON for verification
  - SPKI format needed for importing raw Ed25519 public keys (12-byte header + 32-byte key)
  - Verification response distinguishes between structural errors and signature failures
  - Provider/model claims only returned when signature is valid
---

## 2026-02-02 - CPX-US-006
- Implemented rate limiting using Cloudflare Workers Rate Limiting binding
- Rate limits by DID (X-Client-DID header) or IP address (CF-Connecting-IP fallback)
- Returns 429 with Retry-After header when rate limit exceeded
- All proxy responses now include X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset headers
- Files created:
  - services/clawproxy/src/ratelimit.ts (rate limiting logic, key extraction, header builders)
- Files modified:
  - services/clawproxy/src/types.ts (added RateLimit, RateLimitOutcome interfaces, PROXY_RATE_LIMITER binding)
  - services/clawproxy/src/logging.ts (added RATE_LIMITED security event type, logRateLimited function)
  - services/clawproxy/src/index.ts (integrated rate limiting, added rate limit headers to all responses)
  - services/clawproxy/wrangler.toml (added ratelimits binding configuration)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Cloudflare Rate Limiting period must be 10 or 60 seconds
  - Rate limiting fails open (allows request) if binding is unavailable or errors
  - X-Client-DID header allows agents to be rate limited by identity rather than shared IP
  - Cloudflare doesn't expose exact remaining count; we estimate based on success/failure
  - namespace_id in wrangler.toml is a unique positive integer per account

## 2026-02-02 - CPX-US-007
- Implemented receipt binding fields for proof chaining
- Accept X-Run-Id, X-Event-Hash, X-Idempotency-Key headers to bind receipts to runs/events
- Added ReceiptBinding type with runId, eventHash, nonce fields
- Binding fields are embedded in receipt and included in signed payload
- Implemented idempotency enforcement using in-memory nonce cache
- Duplicate requests with same nonce return previously issued receipt
- Files created:
  - services/clawproxy/src/idempotency.ts (binding header extraction, idempotency cache)
- Files modified:
  - services/clawproxy/src/types.ts (added ReceiptBinding interface, added binding to Receipt and VerifyReceiptResponse)
  - services/clawproxy/src/receipt.ts (added binding to ReceiptInput, updated generateReceipt and createSigningPayload)
  - services/clawproxy/src/index.ts (integrated binding extraction and idempotency, return binding claims in verify)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Binding headers: X-Run-Id, X-Event-Hash, X-Idempotency-Key (defined in idempotency.ts BINDING_HEADERS)
  - Binding is optional - receipts work without binding fields
  - Binding fields are included in createSigningPayload() so they're tamper-proof
  - In-memory nonce cache has 5-minute TTL; production should use Durable Objects or KV for distributed state
  - Idempotency returns the complete response (with receipt), not just the receipt
  - Nonces are recorded even for provider errors to ensure consistent idempotency behavior
---

## 2026-02-02 - CPX-US-008
- Implemented Work Policy Contract (WPC) enforcement for enterprise confidential runs
- Added X-Confidential-Mode and X-Policy-Hash header support
- Enforces provider/model allowlists from WPC (returns 403 on violation)
- Applies field redaction rules to request bodies per WPC configuration
- Policy hash is embedded in receipt binding for verification
- Security logging for POLICY_VIOLATION and POLICY_MISSING events
- Files created:
  - services/clawproxy/src/policy.ts (WPC types, parsing, enforcement, redaction)
- Files modified:
  - services/clawproxy/src/types.ts (added policyHash to ReceiptBinding)
  - services/clawproxy/src/logging.ts (added POLICY_VIOLATION, POLICY_MISSING event types and helpers)
  - services/clawproxy/src/receipt.ts (support policyHash in binding)
  - services/clawproxy/src/index.ts (integrated policy extraction, enforcement, redaction in proxy handler)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - WPC enforcement controlled by X-Confidential-Mode: true header
  - In confidential mode, X-Policy-Hash is required (fails closed with 400)
  - Policy enforcement returns 403 status (not 400) for policy violations
  - Redaction applied to request body BEFORE sending to provider and BEFORE hashing for receipt
  - Demo policies stored in-memory via registerDemoPolicy(); production should use policy registry
  - Redaction supports simplified JSON path patterns: $.field, $.nested.field, $.array[*].field
  - Redaction actions: remove (strips field), mask (replaces with [REDACTED]), hash (marker for async hash)
  - Policy hash is signed as part of receipt binding for tamper-proof audit trail
---

## 2026-02-02 - CPX-US-009
- Implemented hash-only and encrypted receipt modes for privacy protection
- Default privacy mode is hash_only (only requestHash/responseHash in receipts)
- Added X-Receipt-Privacy-Mode header to request encrypted payloads
- Implemented AES-256-GCM encryption for optional encrypted payload receipts
- Encrypted mode automatically blocked in confidential mode (prompts protected)
- Added logConfidentialRequest() to log metadata without plaintext content
- Files modified:
  - services/clawproxy/src/types.ts (added ReceiptPrivacyMode, EncryptedPayload, PROXY_ENCRYPTION_KEY env)
  - services/clawproxy/src/crypto.ts (added AES-256-GCM import/encrypt/decrypt functions)
  - services/clawproxy/src/receipt.ts (added privacyMode, EncryptionContext, encrypted payloads)
  - services/clawproxy/src/policy.ts (added privacy mode extraction and confidential mode restrictions)
  - services/clawproxy/src/logging.ts (added CONFIDENTIAL_REQUEST event, logConfidentialRequest)
  - services/clawproxy/src/index.ts (integrated encryption context and privacy mode)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Privacy mode controlled via X-Receipt-Privacy-Mode header (hash_only | encrypted)
  - AES-256-GCM uses 12-byte IV and 16-byte tag (128-bit) per encryption
  - Encrypted payloads stored in encryptedRequest/encryptedResponse fields of receipt
  - In confidential mode, encrypted mode is silently downgraded to hash_only
  - Encryption key stored as base64url-encoded 32-byte key in PROXY_ENCRYPTION_KEY
  - Encrypted payloads are included in signing payload for tamper-proofing
  - logConfidentialRequest() only logs provider, model, policyHash - NEVER plaintext

## 2026-02-02 - CPX-US-010
- Enhanced GET /v1/did endpoint to return W3C DID Core compliant document
- Added verificationMethod array with Ed25519VerificationKey2020 type and multibase encoding
- Full key IDs use DID#fragment format (e.g., did:web:clawproxy.com#abc123)
- Added @context array referencing DID Core and Ed25519 2020 specs
- Added authentication and assertionMethod key references
- Enhanced deployment metadata: version, signingEnabled, encryptionEnabled, runtime, region, service
- Region extracted from request.cf.colo (Cloudflare datacenter code)
- Added ETag header based on kid for cache validation
- Files modified:
  - services/clawproxy/src/types.ts (added VerificationMethod, DeploymentMetadata interfaces, updated DidResponse)
  - services/clawproxy/src/index.ts (enhanced handleDidEndpoint to build DID document format)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - W3C DID documents use @context, id, verificationMethod, authentication, assertionMethod structure
  - Ed25519 public keys use Ed25519VerificationKey2020 type with publicKeyMultibase encoding
  - Multibase format for base64url uses 'u' prefix before the encoded data
  - Cloudflare request.cf.colo provides datacenter code (e.g., SJC, IAD)
  - ETag header enables conditional requests (If-None-Match) for cache validation
---

## 2026-02-02T04:29:30Z - CPX-US-011
- Implemented scoped token (CST) authentication for proxy calls:
  - If X-Client-DID is present, require X-CST (or X-Scoped-Token)
  - Validate CST as EdDSA JWT (claims schema v1): audience, expiry, and required scope
  - Verify signature using configured CST_ISSUER_PUBLIC_KEY (fail-closed if missing)
  - Log token SHA-256 hash alongside receipt metadata (provider/model + receipt.requestHash + timestamp)
- Files changed:
  - services/clawproxy/src/types.ts
  - services/clawproxy/src/scoped-token.ts
  - services/clawproxy/src/index.ts
  - services/clawproxy/src/logging.ts
  - prd.json
  - progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - With noUncheckedIndexedAccess enabled, avoid destructuring array indices without non-null assertions
  - Keep token logging hash-only and include only receipt hashes/metadata to preserve confidentiality guarantees
