## Codebase Patterns
- Trust vNext work is expected to span multiple services: clawverify, clawproxy, clawea, clwbounties/marketplace, and OpenClaw integration points.
- “Replay” should mean **evidence re-validation** + deterministic checks, not bit-identical LLM output reproduction.
- High trust tiers must be **fail-closed** and should not rely on trusting a worker’s local machine.

## 2026-02-07T19:53:07Z - Roadmap seeded (planning)
- What was implemented
  - Added a new roadmap folder: `docs/roadmaps/trust-vnext/`.
  - Seeded `prd.json` from the synthesis oracle:
    - `docs/roadmaps/proof-of-harness/oracle/2026-02-07/next-building-blocks-plan.gpt-5.2-pro.md`
  - Created this `progress.txt` for append-only progress tracking (Ralph compatible).
- Files changed
  - docs/roadmaps/trust-vnext/README.md
  - docs/roadmaps/trust-vnext/prd.json
  - docs/roadmaps/trust-vnext/progress.txt

## 2026-02-07T23:19:57Z - CVF-US-021
- What was implemented
  - Hardened proof bundle verification by recomputing `event_hash_b64u` for every event using the canonical event header key order (ADAPTER_SPEC_v1 §4.2).
  - Fail-closed: proof bundles are rejected when any `event_hash_b64u` mismatches the recomputed value.
  - Added unit tests to ensure tampering is detected even if the chain links are internally consistent.
- Files changed
  - services/clawverify/src/verify-proof-bundle.ts
  - services/clawverify/test/proof-bundle-event-hash.test.ts
  - docs/roadmaps/trust-vnext/prd.json
  - docs/roadmaps/trust-vnext/progress.txt
- Quality checks
  - cd services/clawverify && npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run lint
