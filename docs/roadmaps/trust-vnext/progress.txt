## Codebase Patterns
- Trust vNext work is expected to span multiple services: clawverify, clawproxy, clawea, clwbounties/marketplace, and OpenClaw integration points.
- “Replay” should mean **evidence re-validation** + deterministic checks, not bit-identical LLM output reproduction.
- High trust tiers must be **fail-closed** and should not rely on trusting a worker’s local machine.
