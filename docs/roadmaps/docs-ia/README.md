# Docs IA / Scope Cleanup Roadmap

This roadmap exists because `docs/` has grown to the point where it’s hard to answer:

- what’s canonical vs exploratory vs archived,
- what’s "current state" vs "future intent",
- what a new contributor should read first,
- and which docs are safe to base implementation decisions on.

## Goals

- Define a clear information architecture (IA) + conventions.
- Reduce cognitive load: make it obvious **what to read** for each kind of work.
- Mark or move outdated docs (archive rather than delete).
- Add a lightweight “freshness/status” convention for key docs.

## Tracking files

- Stories: `docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/prd.json`
- Progress: `docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/progress.txt`
- Oracle audit outputs: `docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/oracle/`
