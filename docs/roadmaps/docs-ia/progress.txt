## Codebase Patterns
- Prefer adding **indexes/READMEs** over dumping more standalone docs.
- Archive rather than delete; preserve history.
- Make “current state” vs “future intent” explicit.

## 2026-02-07T20:13:00Z - DOCS-US-001 (oracle audits)
- What was implemented
  - Generated an inventory of the current `docs/` tree:
    - docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/oracle/2026-02-07/DOCS_INVENTORY.md
  - Ran Oracle audits to propose an IA + status convention + reading maps:
    - docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/oracle/2026-02-07/docs-ia-audit.google-gemini-3-pro-preview.md
    - docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/oracle/2026-02-07/docs-ia-audit.gpt-5.2-pro.md
- Files changed
  - docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/oracle/2026-02-07/*

## 2026-02-07T20:55:00Z - DOCS-US-003 / DOCS-US-004 (status + "what to read")
- What was implemented
  - Added docs templates:
    - docs/_templates/STATUS_BLOCK.md
    - docs/_templates/DOC_RULES.md
  - Added reading paths by audience:
    - docs/WHAT_TO_READ.md
  - Added status banners across key hubs/specs/roadmaps so it’s clearer what is canonical vs planning.
- Files changed
  - docs/README.md
  - docs/WHAT_TO_READ.md
  - docs/_templates/*
  - many `docs/**/README.md` + core docs
---

## 2026-02-07T21:27:00Z - DOCS-US-001 (IA scaffolding + minimal-disruption moves)
- What was implemented
  - Introduced IA subfolders:
    - docs/foundations/
    - docs/specs/
    - docs/integration/
    - docs/plans/
    - docs/archive/
  - Moved core docs out of the root into the new structure and added redirect stubs at the old paths to preserve links.
  - Updated key references to point at the new canonical paths (while leaving stubs for compatibility).
- Files changed
  - docs/foundations/*
  - docs/specs/agent-economy/MVP.md
  - docs/integration/OPENCLAW_INTEGRATION.md
  - docs/plans/*
  - docs/README.md
  - docs/WHAT_TO_READ.md
  - docs/ecosystem/AGENTS.md
  - docs/roadmaps/proof-of-harness/ADAPTER_SPEC_v1.md
  - docs/roadmaps/trust-vnext/prd.json
  - docs/prds/* (OpenClaw integration link update)
---

## 2026-02-07T21:36:00Z - DOCS-US-002 (PRD alignment sweep) + PoH spec drift fix
- What was implemented
  - Updated PoH adapter spec to reflect that gateway receipt envelope format/DID method are now resolved (POH-US-009/010).
  - Added status blocks + an "Implementation status" section to **all** domain PRDs:
    - Implemented domains link their service trackers under `services/*/{prd.json,progress.txt}`
    - Non-implemented domains are explicitly labeled as aspirational (no tracker yet)
- Files changed
  - docs/roadmaps/proof-of-harness/ADAPTER_SPEC_v1.md
  - docs/prds/*.md
