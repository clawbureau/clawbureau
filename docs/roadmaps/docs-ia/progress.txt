## Codebase Patterns
- Prefer adding **indexes/READMEs** over dumping more standalone docs.
- Archive rather than delete; preserve history.
- Make “current state” vs “future intent” explicit.

## 2026-02-07T20:13:00Z - DOCS-US-001 (oracle audits)
- What was implemented
  - Generated an inventory of the current `docs/` tree:
    - docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/oracle/2026-02-07/DOCS_INVENTORY.md
  - Ran Oracle audits to propose an IA + status convention + reading maps:
    - docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/oracle/2026-02-07/docs-ia-audit.google-gemini-3-pro-preview.md
    - docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/oracle/2026-02-07/docs-ia-audit.gpt-5.2-pro.md
- Files changed
  - docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/oracle/2026-02-07/*

## 2026-02-07T20:55:00Z - DOCS-US-003 / DOCS-US-004 (status + "what to read")
- What was implemented
  - Added docs templates:
    - docs/_templates/STATUS_BLOCK.md
    - docs/_templates/DOC_RULES.md
  - Added reading paths by audience:
    - docs/WHAT_TO_READ.md
  - Added status banners across key hubs/specs/roadmaps so it’s clearer what is canonical vs planning.
- Files changed
  - docs/README.md
  - docs/WHAT_TO_READ.md
  - docs/_templates/*
  - many `docs/**/README.md` + core docs
---

## 2026-02-07T21:27:00Z - DOCS-US-001 (IA scaffolding + minimal-disruption moves)
- What was implemented
  - Introduced IA subfolders:
    - docs/foundations/
    - docs/specs/
    - docs/integration/
    - docs/plans/
    - docs/archive/
  - Moved core docs out of the root into the new structure and added redirect stubs at the old paths to preserve links.
  - Updated key references to point at the new canonical paths (while leaving stubs for compatibility).
- Files changed
  - docs/foundations/*
  - docs/specs/agent-economy/MVP.md
  - docs/integration/OPENCLAW_INTEGRATION.md
  - docs/plans/*
  - docs/README.md
  - docs/WHAT_TO_READ.md
  - docs/ecosystem/AGENTS.md
  - docs/roadmaps/proof-of-harness/ADAPTER_SPEC_v1.md
  - docs/roadmaps/trust-vnext/prd.json
  - docs/prds/* (OpenClaw integration link update)
---

## 2026-02-07T21:36:00Z - DOCS-US-002 (PRD alignment sweep) + PoH spec drift fix
- What was implemented
  - Updated PoH adapter spec to reflect that gateway receipt envelope format/DID method are now resolved (POH-US-009/010).
  - Added status blocks + an "Implementation status" section to **all** domain PRDs:
    - Implemented domains link their service trackers under `services/*/{prd.json,progress.txt}`
    - Non-implemented domains are explicitly labeled as aspirational (no tracker yet)
- Files changed
  - docs/roadmaps/proof-of-harness/ADAPTER_SPEC_v1.md
  - docs/prds/*.md
---

## 2026-02-07T21:40:00Z - DOCS-US-002 (archive Protocol M planning bundle)
- What was implemented
  - Archived the sibling planning-only `protocol-m` folder into the monorepo archive:
    - `docs/archive/protocol-m-phase-1/`
  - Added an archive note pointing to the current plan-of-record (PoH + Trust vNext + schemas).
- Files changed
  - docs/archive/protocol-m-phase-1/*
  - docs/ecosystem/STRATEGIC_PLAN.md
  - docs/archive/README.md
---

## 2026-02-12T18:00:00Z - DOCS-US-001/002/003/004 (closure)
- What was implemented
  - DOCS-US-001: Written formal IA proposal (docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/IA_PROPOSAL.md) classifying all 222 docs into canonical/active/draft/archive. Folder structure codified. Archiving rules defined.
  - DOCS-US-002: Verified all redirect stubs are in place. Archive folder active with protocol-M planning bundle. No broken internal links found.
  - DOCS-US-003: Status blocks verified on all 20 most-referenced docs (foundations, specs, indexes, roadmap READMEs). Added status block to ADOPTION_GUIDE.md.
  - DOCS-US-004: WHAT_TO_READ.md expanded with 3 new audience paths: protocol adopter (7 docs), economy/risk developer (5 docs + PRDs), enterprise buyer (7 docs + external Security Review Pack link).
- Tracker flips
  - DOCS-US-001, DOCS-US-002, DOCS-US-003, DOCS-US-004 → passes=true
  - **Docs-IA roadmap: 4/4 COMPLETE.**
- Files changed
  - docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/IA_PROPOSAL.md (new)
  - docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/prd.json
  - docs/roadmaps/docs-ia/progress.txt
  - docs/WHAT_TO_READ.md
  - docs/specs/clawsig-protocol/ADOPTION_GUIDE.md (status block added)
